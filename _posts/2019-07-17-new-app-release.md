It’s official. I released my first app today. I was just something I hacked together while traveling to track the money I was spending. Available on the iOS App Store. [Cash: Daily](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cash-daily/id1471456584){:target="_blank"} Hopefully I’ll have the Android version out shortly. Leave me good reviews!

$0.99 so it is pretty cheap.  Just a simple app to manage your cash flow and daily expenses.  I use it a lot while traveling.
